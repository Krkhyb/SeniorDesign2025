**SPE3D Humidity Sensor Repository**

This repository is for a senior design project for University of Science and Technology. Utilizing a HS3003, Rassberry Pi 5, and an LCD we are gathering humidity data on a SPEE3D machine on campus, recording data in a database, and allowing users to output specific data to a csv file for easy export.

Files included here: Gerber of both main PCB and sensor PCB, and schematics.
