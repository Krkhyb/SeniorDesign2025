To start logging utilize the setuptSensorHum.sh script to enable all necessary libraries and 
other systems needed for the data logging. Check to ensure all checks are completed, if any 
errors restart the script. 

Once on the system will start recording data every 30 seconds and importing the data to a sql 
lite 3 database. From there we are able to take specific time stamps and dates from the 
database and export it as a csv file for easy import to an excel file for graphing and other 
utilities. To do so run this command in the terminal of the pi:[ echo "2025-01-01_00:00:00 
2025-01-10_23:59:59" > export_request.txt ] while changing the date and times as needed for 
correct data export.
